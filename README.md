# pokemon-oneshot-cluster

## You are playing Pokemon Yellow. You have low HP and you want to know if its safe to try and one-shot your foe. This is the data for you.

This repo is a cluster analysis of the 151 original Pokemon classified by speed and HP. Your health is low and you want to see the viability of 'hail-marying' and trying to one-shot your foe. Against which Pokémon you can safely do so?

### The process

The raw data was cleaned using 'Spyder IDE'

The process was fairly simple, as I only needed to extract the original 151 Pokémon.
The solution was as simple as:
'gen1_df = df[df.Generation == 1]'
